Works both on Windows and Linux. <br />
To run:
```properties
php scraper.php
```
If the script is throwing errors, which it does if you are using a VPN, then use slow mode.

```properties
php scraper.php -mode slow
```

The working keys are written in text files with the model name (gpt-4.txt, gpt-3.5-turbo.txt).
